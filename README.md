# Project description

Your company is selling digital games in an online store. The storefront is getting a lot of traffic,
and the game catalog is vast. Visitors can browse, search, add games to a shopping cart, and
when they are ready, they can go to order finalization, as registered users if they like. There is a
back office admin panel, where employees can manage games catalog, adjust prices etc, and
they do it quite often - they work on drafts, change it many times, and then publish the changes.

Your task is to propose the architecture, storage, and the application itself, in a way you see
most appropriate. Please deliver the code, and whatever extra description youâ€™d like, in any
form (description, diagrams, etc.)
